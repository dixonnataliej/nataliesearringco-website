# Website to Showcase NataliesEarringCo

## About the Project

Welcome to the repository for the website for my crochet earring business- NataliesEarringCo! This project is both a passion project and a coding endeavor, aiming to create a visually appealing and functional platform to showcase my earrings. While it is not intended to replicate the full functionality of platforms like Shopify, it serves as a portfolio-style site for those who want to view my earring designs in one placeâ€”especially for those who may not use Instagram.

This project is inspired by my coursework in Web Systems and serves as an opportunity to apply concepts I've learned while exploring additional features and web development techniques.
