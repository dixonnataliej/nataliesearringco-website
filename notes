- Add home/about/subtab pages to right of name in header to use the space, like peripheral shop's website
- use clientside/js/react so users can click on tags to sort w/o a refresh
- underline tab names (ex about) when user hovers over them mmmm so cool
- created line in database is just for me to see when I made listings, only make visible to owner
- at some point i'll figure out login, really only want the owner to be able to log in (secret button?)
- disclaimer on website that this is a CS coding project for me! hence why no built in shop feature etc
- FAQ, "shopping" cart section (a place to save what you've been looking at (temporarily i think i don't want to get into accounts and cookies) with the contact button to DM or email me about buying)
- omg should i put a search feature in?? i mean technically i know how to do it, what a culminative post 485 project this would be then. it would be pretty simple search though
- do i want the client facing url to be posts/<post name> or something like products/<post-name> ?
- automatic new tag feature - when new earrings are posted, give them the new tag, then prompt to delete new tags off of earrings posted more than one or two weeks ago
- add in tag identification (select from existing tags/add new tag) to create post feature
- currently making separate static js files for just little buttons i'm adding in as opposed to in my react component section, not sure if this is best practice
- I should make lots of things ex the overlap in create/edit/delete post into helper functions. later efficiency work

ADDRESSED
- fix url for posts - add dashes i think the white space is causing problems
- will have to change pagination when i implement tags - add tags as a variable for which posts show up
