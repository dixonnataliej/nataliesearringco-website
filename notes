- Add home/about/subtab pages to right of name in header to use the space, like peripheral shop's website
- use clientside/js/react so users can click on tags to sort w/o a refresh
- underline tab names (ex about) when user hovers over them mmmm so cool
- created line in database is just for me to see when I made listings, only make visible to owner
- at some point i'll figure out login, really only want the owner to be able to log in (secret button?)
- disclaimer on website that this is a CS coding project for me! hence why no built in shop feature etc
- FAQ, "shopping" cart section (a place to save what you've been looking at (temporarily i think i don't want to get into accounts and cookies) with the contact button to DM or email me about buying)
- omg should i put a search feature in?? i mean technically i know how to do it, what a culminative post 485 project this would be then. it would be pretty simple search though
